Sing It! Indie Song Quiz
Sing It! is a simple, browser-based quiz game for fans of Indian Indie music. The game tests players' knowledge of popular songs from artists like Anuv Jain, Prateek Kuhad, The Local Train, and more.

How it Works
The game's core functionality is a simple three-step process:

New Song: The app selects a random song from a curated list of popular indie tracks.

Get Hint: If a player doesn't know the song, they can get hints in three stages:

An emoji clue.

A short lyrical cue or description.

The full, most famous lyric line from the song.

Sang It!: When a player correctly identifies the song and sings the hook, they get a point.

Players can also add their names to a leaderboard to keep score, and the data can be exported to a JSON file.

Features
Simple Interface: Clean and minimal design to focus on the game.

Player Scoreboard: Add multiple players and track their scores.

Progressive Hints: Three levels of hints to help players guess the song.

Export Leaderboard: Save the current game's scores to a local file.
